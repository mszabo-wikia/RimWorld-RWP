# RWP - Romulan Weaponized Plasma

An assortment of various performance patches for RimWorld by Ludeon Studios that
primarily aim to reduce the visible performance impact of the game's job system on large colonies,
alongside various smaller improvements.

The main goal of the mod is to make overall TPS more stable, and slightly improve it if possible.
On a save with 86 pawns and 138 animals, the mod has helped keep a stable 120-130 TPS instead of
frequent TPS drops to 80-90.

## Philosophy
By design, the only visible difference of running the game with or without this mod should be its effects
on performance (hopefully positive!). So, if you're seeing gameplay/behavior changes, or you feel compelled to
change your playstyle due to having installed the mod, then that's a bug. In the same spirit, it should be safe
for you to add the mod to an existing save or remove it without any impact on your save.
